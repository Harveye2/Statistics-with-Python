# Statistics-with-Python

## Introduction
This project is from the Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree. The aim of this project was to investigate a classic phenomenon from experimental psychology called the Stroop Effect. The Stroop Effect is a demonstration of interference in the reaction time of a task. The Stroop task investigated for this project was a list of congruent and incongruent coloured words. The congruent words were colour words whose names matched the colors in which they were printed (eg. the word 'blue' is printed in blue ink). The incongruent words were colour words whose names did not match the colors in which they were printed (eg. the word 'blue' is printed in red ink).

For the purpose of this project, a data set was provided, containing the reaction times of 24 paricipants, to name the congruent and incongruent words outloud. The aim of this project was to identify if, on average, indivduals have a longer reaction time to name the colours of incongruent words compared to congruent words. 

## Statistical Test Methods
In order to to determine if the average difference in the reaction times recorded for the 24 participants, in the Stroop Effect task, was significantly significant, the liklihood of observing a difference in the mean reaction times, for the population at large, was determined using the following methods:
1) Hypothesis testing
2) t-Test
3) Bootstrapping Simulations

## Installation 
The following python libraries were imported for the purpose of this project:
-  scipy.stats
-  numpy
-  pandas
-  matplotlib.pyplot

## Data
The data used for this project is provided in this repository as stroopdata.csv
